## Activity Steps

1. Install node. https://nodejs.org/en/
2. Create a folder named node-activity and create an app.js file inside it.
3. Import the "http" module using "require()". Save the module as a const variable called "http".

- Hint: You can import a module into your file using the following syntax:

```
const moduleName = require('moduleName');
```

4. Create a simple server using the ".createServer()" method and assign it to a const variable called "server". Using the "server" object, make your newly created server listen on port "4001".

5. Inside the callback function of the ".createServer()" method, have the server return a response of 'Hello World' using the ".end()" method.

6. Create a GitHub repository and upload. Send the link to Discord.
